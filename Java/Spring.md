1. At its core, Spring offers a container, often referred to as the Spring application context, that creates and manages application components.
2. The components, commonly referred to as beans.
3. The act of wiring beans together is based on a pattern known as dependency injection(DI).
4. Spring Boot starter dependencies (normal and stater two diffrent types) are special in that they typically donâ€™t have any library code themselves but instead transitively pull in other libraries.
5. Servlets are used in Spring-MVC. In Spring-MVC when you write annotation like @Controller, indirectly you are using a Servlet called Dispatcher Servlet.
