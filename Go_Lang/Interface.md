* An interface specifies a set of method signatures without defining what the method would do(you can't do this with Struct) and any type that implements those methods automatically satisfies the interface.See OOP Abstraction for more.
* Interface can also be used as any type in variable ans functions
```go
var i interface{} = "hello"
```
